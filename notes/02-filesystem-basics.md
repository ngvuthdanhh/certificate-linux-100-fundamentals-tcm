# Module 2 – Navigating the Filesystem

## Linux Directory Structure
- `/` – root directory.
- `/home` – user directories.
- `/etc` – configuration files.
- `/var` – variable data (logs, spools).
- `/bin`, `/sbin` – essential binaries.
- `/usr` – user programs.

## Important Commands
- `pwd` – print working directory.
- `ls -la` – list files with details.
- `cd` – change directory.
- `tree` – show directory structure.

## Paths
- Absolute path: starts from `/`.
- Relative path: relative to current directory.
